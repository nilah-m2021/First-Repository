//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
12 + 46 + 2356

10230 - 3780

567 + 78

23 - 167

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 1012

456 * 23

1209 * 345
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
24 / 6

678 / 25

906799 / 5609

//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(3900 - 5340 + 210) / 3
(6748 * 2333) + 1788
(-162 / 2) - 583
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
